Summary:
	For this challenge we are working with APIs to download information/data from outside of our home computers.  From there we can then take the data that we received from the servers and create CSV files to store locally and on GitHub so we can have a stable and quicker time retrieving the data that we have already pulled.
	As seen in the images/figures provided below we then took the information from open weather and placed the data on top of a map provided by Google.  While using our Google API we were also able to find hotels and make a mockup travel itinerary based off of the weather information obtained from Open Weather and the city data provided by Google.

As seen in the images this can be just the beginning of what we can do with APIs and the data that we receive from these companies that store their data and allow developers to access their data whether it is for a fee or for free.
